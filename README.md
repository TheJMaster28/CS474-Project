Project chosen: 
    Project 9:
    A runway of airplanes at an airport. The runway can have only one plane on it at one time. There are two types of planes: planes taking off and planes landing. For each plane     that takes off, one must land. As well, planes must take off in the order in which they enter the takeoff queue. Planes must land in the order in which they enter the landing     queue. Use semaphores to design a synchronization scheme with some properties.
